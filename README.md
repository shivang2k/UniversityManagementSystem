# Title - University Management System

# Introduction

### What is Data?

Data is a collection of distinct information which can serve multiple purposes. Data is used in a variety of forms like text, numbers, media and many more. It is basically information that can be translated into a particular form for efficient movement and processing.

### What is a Database?

A Database is a well organized collection of structured data which makes it easily accessible, manageable and update(changeable).

### What is a Database Management System?

A Database management system or DBMS is a software that is used to manage Databases. It receives instruction from a Database Administrator (DBA) and then instructs the system to make the required changes. Various commands or Queries are used to load, retrieve or modify existing data from the system.

### What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.

# Title of the Project

This project is on **University Management System** , which focuses -

1. On maintaining records of Students, faculty, staff members and parents of students.
2. On developing a university portal for students to access their data and marks, for parents to access their child&#39;s data and marks, for faculty to access their data and upload marks.

This project was developed from the point of view of both users and developers, so that users have a single platform to access their data and developers have a single codebase and database to manage.

# Abstract

In today's world, no university can run without a university management system. A university management system is a web based solution that tries to solve challenges universities face with the capability to restructure the institute for good. This University Management System comes with several modules. Some of the modules are:

1. **Student Module**
2. **Faculty Module**
3. **Parents Module**
4. **Admin Module**

To properly structure the system a database is also designed and developed keeping in mind every possible situation.

# Problems which require solution provided by this project

The main problem with existing Learning Management Systems and University Management systems is that they are neither efficient in terms of performance, they are slow, insecure and adding modules and fixing bugs takes a lot of time. Further it is very difficult to access these existing solutions on mobile phones and they require good bandwidth.

# Problems solved by this project

### Performance Improvement

By designing and building an efficient database the performance of any system can be improved manyfolds. This University Management System has an efficient database along with a good backend and frontend for great performance.

### Security Improvement

By using start of the art technology, in this case, Python, to build the backend the whole system is secured.

### Performance on Mobile Phones

Since all the major work is done on the backend (Server), the device on which the system will run, will not face any performance issue.


# Brief Background of the existing Knowledge

A management system is used by any organization in order to maintain the records for future references and easiness in their work as it is following some set of protocols. It eliminates chances of frauds or misleading figures.


# Technologies Used

1. MySQL - For creating and managing database
2. Python - As a backend programing language
3. Flask - As a framework over python to build and deploy a website
4. MySQL Workbench - To design ER diagram of the database.
5. MySQL library for Python

## SQL advantages over other file management Systems:

1. Reduced data redundancy.
2. There is reduced updating errors and increased consistency
3. Improved data access to users through the use of host and query languages.
4. Data security is also improved.

# Distinguishing Features of the project from the current technology

This project is made using state of the art back end programming language, Python + Flask along with MySQL. The overall project is modular, easy to scale and deploy from the side of a developer, also the User Interface is developed keeping in mind that i9t should be easy to use and can load up on any device without using much of a bandwidth.

# Additional Information / conclusion

This project is about designing and developing a database and a website that can be used by a university for keeping track of its students, faculty, etc.. In my project the database facility helps the university to keep the records for future purpose by not writing them manually but using the database of the University Management system.
